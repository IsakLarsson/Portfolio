          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am currently a fifth year student at the MSc Interaction
            technology and design programme at Ume√• University, Sweden.
            Cornerstones of the programme are UX-design, interactivity and
            accessability but also software development in a wide range of
            different technologies. My main interests are both front-end and
            back-end development as well as AI and UX-design. I'm always curious
            towards new technology and I'm always ready to learn new things.
          </p>
